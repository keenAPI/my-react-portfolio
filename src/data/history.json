I was also introduced to the principles of Object Orientated Programming (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism). I was given projects to display my skills, not just focusing on the coding side but also on my presentation skills. I had to present my work to the Senior Developers which helped a lot with my confidents and public class, I mean public speaking! After the first 6 months I was introduced to the 'Live Client' phase where the team and I worked on Live Client projects to maintain web-applications and also build them based on the client's needs for the next 6 months."],
