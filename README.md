# my-react-portfolio
I created a Portfolio in React where I made use of CSS, HTML, JavaScript and JSX. What I like about this portfolio website is that it will always need updating because I will always be gaining experience. I am very proud of myself for creating this 
and it just gives me more motivation knowing that the possiblities are endless and you just have to keep believing in yourself and put in the hard work. This project is not 100% complete and there are still a couple of enhancments to be made.
