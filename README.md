# my-react-portfolio
I created a Portfolio in React where I made use of CSS, HTML, JavaScript and JSX. What I like about this portfolio website is that it will always need updating because I will always be gaining experience and I will have to add that to my portfolio which I created.
I am very proud of myself for creating this and it just gives me more motivation knowing that the possiblities are endless and you just have to keep believing in yourself and put in the hard work. This portfolio of mine is not completed as of yet.
I believe that there will always be enhancments to be made.
